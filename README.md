# MovieCard



I am creating a 2 pages SPA.
First one is movie list, second one is selected movie details.
Movie cards should be aligned one by one in the first page when we scroll we should see other movie's card.
You see the third one. It is not a different page. When user click the 'add to watchlist' button color should change.
